# Wine Quality Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Wine Quality Dataset, focusing on red variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. We explore the relationships between various chemical properties and wine quality ratings to gain insights and build predictive models.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (target variable)

## Key Features
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of correlations between chemical properties and wine quality
- Implementation of machine learning models for quality prediction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models

## Key Findings
- Alcohol content shows the strongest positive correlation with wine quality
- Volatile acidity has a notable negative correlation with quality
- Other factors like sulphates and citric acid also influence wine quality

## Machine Learning Models
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regressor

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook: `wine-quality.ipynb`

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with feature engineering to improve model performance
- Implement more advanced machine learning algorithms
- Extend the analysis to include white wine variants
